- I'm Tuan Nguyen, graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in the University of Texas at Dallas. 
  My cumulative GPA is 3.93 / 4.00 and I graduated in May 2021.
  When not having schoolwork, I spend my time reading and learning new front-end technologies, like React and Redux.
  I am actively looking for a full-time job.
